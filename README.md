### Project Abstract
The goal of this project is to create a web application that uses twitter and sentiment analysis to determine the public opinion about businesses, products, and people based on location. Once the public opinion has been determined, we will use data visualization to display the sentiment analysis based on geographic location. In addition to being able to see the public opinion, the users will be able to see what other words are associated with their object of interest. This product is intended to be used by businesses to analyze their products, and the public to decide where to work or what to buy.

## Project Description
MARV is a web applicatin that allows users to determine the public opinion by geographic location of the item or company they are interested in researching.
