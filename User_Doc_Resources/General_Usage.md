# General Usage
## How to search
Once you have the app running (See: [Getting Started](./Getting_Started.md)) you will see a big search bar at the top middle of the page. Type in the keyword that you are interested in analyzing and click the search icon or press enter.

## Recommended keywords
This application will use the keyword that you type in to pull related tweets to run sentiment analysis on. These results will be shown in the data visulations (See: [Data Visulation](./Data_Vis.md)). Also the application will show rating associated with your keyword on the map (See: [Googe Map](./Map.md)). Because the Google Map shows rating the best results will come up when you search for businesses. Bellow are suggested keywords to test the application,
- Starbucks
- McDonalds
- Walmart
- Amazon
- Nike
- Kroger

## Tips and Tricks
- You can click on any of the data visualization elements (pie chart, emoji bar chart, and wordcloud) to see a list of the associated tweets.
- If the map is not updating, refresh your screen. This may happen if you search for a company that can't be found on the map.
