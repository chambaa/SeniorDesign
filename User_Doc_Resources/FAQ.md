# FAQ
## Why are no ratings showing up on the map
If there are no ratings populating on the map then your keyword most likely does not have locations associated with it. Try to search for a business instead. Data Visulations should still be working.
## Why are the data visulations not populating
If the data visulations graphs are not populating this means that the twitter API either failed or did not return any data.
## What should I try if the app is not running
Try updating node.js (`sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade nodejs`).
