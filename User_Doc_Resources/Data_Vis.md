# Data Visualizations
## Manipulation
- Some of the graphs used to represent the emotions associated with the keyword search are manipulable.
- Bar charts, for example, are sortable based on highest to lowest, alphabetical order, lowest to highest, etc. 
- An example of this can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-transitions)
  
## Filtering
- Not all sentiments are necessary to view at once. To filter the sentiments shown on the visualization, just click one of the sentiments in the legend and the graph will update without that sentimentâ€™s data. To make it reappear, simply click it again.
  
## Explanation
- All charts will have some kind of explanation that can be toggled by clicking the question mark icon underneath the chart. This will make a caption box appear underneath that graphic that will explain what the information displayed by the visualization.
