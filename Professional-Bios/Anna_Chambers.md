## Project Sought
I am interested in doing either web or mobile app development for this capstone project. I have an interest in sentiment analysis and would like to do a project where I expand upon what has been done in this area and use this analysis in practical, real-world scenarios. I also would like to do a project where I can learn a new skill set to add to my resume.
