# Taskslist:

## Veronica
1. Research viable APIs to use for obtaining twitter location data.
    - Decide which one to use and learn how to use it
2. Develop code that makes use of the API and stores the output data.
    - Figure out how best to store this data so it can act as an input for the sentiment analysis API
3. Design WebApp UI.
    - Decide how the UI should be formatted including how searches will be input
4. Investigate best ways to present data gathered in a visual format.
    - Research different ways other applications present location and sentiment analysis in a visual formatt
5. Develop code to present output data on a map.
    - The code will use the data collected by the APIs and present them on a map

## Anna
6. Research Sentiment Analysis APIs.
    - Decide on the best option to use for our purposes. Evaluate based on price and information provided.
7. Develop code that pulls from the stored twitter data and uses the sentiment analysis API to determine the emotion associated.
    - Make use of the decided sentiment API to gain insight on the twitter data.
8. Develop an algorithm for determining relevance of a tweet.
    - Investigate what percentage of likes/retweets qualifies a tweet as popular opinion and implement an algorithm to determine tweet weight.
9. Design a front-end component to allow the user to specify a time frame.
    - Design and implement a front-end component that allows the user to set a specific time frame to retrieve the twitter data for.
10. Host WebApp on the cloud so that it can be accessed publicly.
    - Determine the best way to host the WebApp (Azure, AWS, ect) and follow necessary steps to make it publicly accessible.

## Reed
11. Specify unit tests to ensure product is working correctly.
    - Evaluate each separate component and ensure we receive desired outputs with specified inputs.
12. Ensure mapping functionality is accurate in sentiment marker placement.
    - Verify that sentiment markers that are created via the map cdn (for example mapbox) are placed in the corresponding locations.
13. Design accessibility features for the webapp.
    - Design functionality to make webapp features accessible to a wide variety of users.
14. Research public opinion for cross-reference validation.
    - Validate the results of the sentiment analysis AI by cross-referencing general opinion of a subject from a sample of returned locations.
15. Develop functionality for customizable return outputs.
    - Allow users to customize the results of their search and export the results in their desired format.

## Mario
16. Design viable structured format for code.
    - Create a well designed infrastructure to build the front and back end code.
17. Troubleshoot possible bugs depending on project stage.
    - Properly test the extent of the application to discover any relevant bugs.
18. Develop comparison landing page based of location.
    - Research the possible implementation of a comparison feature depending on user selection.
19. Research relevant statistics that users and businesses can use.
    - Depending on whether user/business, create a structured feed that finds relevant information towards specified group of people.
20. Contribute to overall development of code.
    - Implement desired features for the back-end and front-end of the application.
